                <h2>The Logic of Raycasting</h2>
                <p>Raycasting creates a 3D illusion from 2D data. Imagine standing in a grid-based maze and casting rays in every direction you look. Each ray travels until it hits a wall, then measures the distance. Closer walls appear taller on screen, farther walls appear shorter. By repeating this for every vertical slice of your screen, you build a perspective view—all without true 3D graphics. It's a clever trick that turns math into immersion.</p>

                <h2>The Copy-Paste Coordinate Bug</h2>
                <p>When implementing game save persistence, I wrote player coordinates to a file with a classic copy-paste error:</p>
                <code>print(player.x, player.x)  // Oops: second should be player.y</code>
                <p>The bug was invisible in the code—two player.x calls look nearly identical at a glance. But when loading, the player's Y coordinate would read as the X value, spawning them in mathematically impossible positions. Walls would render at bizarre angles because the raycasting algorithm received contradictory coordinate data.

It took systematic testing to isolate: creating save points at specific locations, then checking where the game thought I was after reloading. The lesson wasn't about attention to detail—it was about how our brains see what we expect to see, not what's actually there.</p>
